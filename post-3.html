        Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as
        members of the fungus kingdom. The first yeast originated hundreds of
        millions of years ago, and at least 1,500 species are currently
        recognized. They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal
        species.

        Yeast, the most common one being S. cerevisiae, is used in baking as a
        leavening agent, where it converts the food/fermentable sugars present
        in dough into the gas carbon dioxide. This causes the dough to expand or
        rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast
        dies and the air pockets "set", giving the baked product a soft and
        spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, eggs, or
        sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most yeasts
        used in baking are of the same species common in alcoholic fermentation.
        In addition, Saccharomyces exiguus (also known as S. minor), a wild
        yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is occasionally used for
        baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires aerobically,
        producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted,
        fermentation begins, producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this
        evaporates during baking.
