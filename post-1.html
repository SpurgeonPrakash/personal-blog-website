        <b>Sourdough bread</b> is made by the fermentation of dough using
        naturally occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a more
        sour taste and better inherent keeping qualities than breads made with
        baker's yeast, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.

      <p>
        The starter is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the
        desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the
        total flour weight, though formulas may vary. The dough is shaped into
        loaves, left to rise, and then baked. A number of 'no knead' methods are
        available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread
        takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to
        baking. This process is known as 'retardation' to slow down the proofing
        process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer
        flavoured bread.
