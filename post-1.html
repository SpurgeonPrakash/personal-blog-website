        Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally
        occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a more sour taste
        and better inherent keeping qualities than breads made with baker's
        yeast, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.

        The starter is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the
        desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the
        total flour weight, though formulas may vary. The dough is shaped into
        loaves, left to rise, and then baked. A number of 'no knead' methods are
        available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread
        takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to
        baking. This process is known as 'retardation' to slow down the proofing
        process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer
        flavoured bread.

        Because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of
        breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally
        unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been
        proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can
        then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of
        the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the
        machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but
        the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked
        sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this
        usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of
        the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development
        requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin.
