          Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally
          occurring lactobacilli and yeast. Sourdough bread has a more sour
          taste and better inherent keeping qualities than breads made with
          baker's yeast, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.

          Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as
          members of the fungus kingdom. The first yeast originated hundreds of
          millions of years ago, and at least 1,500 species are currently
          recognized. They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described
          fungal species.

          Flour is a powder made by grinding raw grains, roots, beans, nuts, or
          seeds. Flours are used to make many different foods. Cereal flour is
          the main ingredient of bread, which is a staple food for most
          cultures. Wheat flour is one of the most important ingredients in
          Oceanic, European, South American, North American, Middle Eastern,
          North Indian and North African cultures, and is the defining
          ingredient in their styles of breads and pastries. Corn flour has been
          important in Mesoamerican cuisine since ancient times and remains a
          staple in the Americas. Rye flour is a constituent of bread in central
          Europe.
