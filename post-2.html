        Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as
        members of the fungus kingdom. The first yeast originated hundreds of
        millions of years ago, and at least 1,500 species are currently
        recognized. They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal
        species.

        Yeast, the most common one being S. cerevisiae, is used in baking as a
        leavening agent, where it converts the food/fermentable sugars present
        in dough into the gas <u>carbon dioxide</u>. This causes the dough to
        expand or rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked,
        the yeast dies and the air pockets "set", giving the baked product a
        soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling,
        eggs, or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most
        yeasts used in baking are of the same species common in alcoholic
        fermentation. In addition, Saccharomyces exiguus (also known as S.
        minor), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is
        occasionally used for baking.
